# ml-projects

This repository contains a variety of Machine Learning projects and implementations, including both complete and simple classification and prediction projects, and also foundational algorithms developed from scratch. It showcases practical applications and theoretical insights across different machine learning methodologies.

## Cool projects

- [**Insurance Market Customer Segmentation**](unsupervised-learning/insurance-market-segmentation/insurance-market-segmentation.ipynb): An unsupervised learning project focused on segmenting customers in the insurance market. It also includes an efficient supervised classifier based on the cluster predictions.
- [**CABA Apartments Price Prediction**](supervised-learning/caba-apartment-price-prediction/caba-apartments.ipynb): A predictive modeling project focused on forecasting apartment prices in Buenos Aires, employing various regression techniques.
- [**IMDb Review Classification**](supervised-learning/imdb-review-classification/imdb.ipynb): A classification task using natural language processing to categorize IMDb movie reviews as positive or negative, with both traditional and out-of-core learning approaches. It also has a possible way of categorizing based on a unsupervised topic classification.
