It also features comprehensive analyses and typical data science workflows, and showcases practical applications and theoretical insights across different machine learning methodologies.

## Cool projects

- [**CNN-based Smile Recognition**](/deep-learning/CelebA-attributes-classification/CelebA-attributes-classification.ipynb): A Convolutional Neural Network model trained on the CelebA dataset. This model focuses on classifying whether a face in a given image is smiling or not. The project demonstrates data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation, providing insights into deep learning techniques for image classification tasks.
- [**Insurance Market Customer Segmentation**](unsupervised-learning/insurance-market-segmentation/insurance-market-segmentation.ipynb): An unsupervised learning project focused on segmenting customers in the insurance market. It also includes an efficient supervised classifier based on the cluster predictions.
- [**IMDb Review Classification**](supervised-learning/imdb-review-classification/imdb.ipynb): A classification task using natural language processing to categorize IMDb movie reviews as positive or negative, with both traditional and out-of-core learning approaches. It also has a possible way of categorizing based on a unsupervised topic classification.
- [**CABA Apartments Price Prediction**](supervised-learning/caba-apartment-price-prediction/caba-apartments.ipynb): A predictive modeling project focused on forecasting apartment prices in Buenos Aires, employing various regression techniques.
